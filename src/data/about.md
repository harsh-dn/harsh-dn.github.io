# Intro

I am a software development engineer at [Walmart](https://one.walmart.com/content/globaltechindia/en_in.html) where I build tools for better management of supply chain, deliver quickly, accurately, and at scale. I am particularly interested in projects that touch blockchain, social impact, and retail. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Walmart, I am learning how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships. I primarily work as a coder but getting experience across industrial management.

# Some history

- Started cricket when I was 6. It was an old wooden bat that was not in shape. To this day, I still don't know how I hit the balls.

- At 10, my parents bought me a kodak reel camera and a digital nikon at 12. It could fit 100 images to a disk at a 0.3MP resolution. It got stolen in a train journey.
